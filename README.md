# fintech-timeseries-and-regression
This project is the start of Machine Learning as part of my FinTech homework, incorporating some time-series forecasting and linear regression modelling.  I use [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html), [ski-kit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (as well as the now staple numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib) for modelling, all within Jupyter Labs Notebooks; my work builds on coursework that I am involved in.

## Instructions / Intro
Within this Project, there are two Jupyter Notebooks.
 - Time-series Analysis (time_series_analysis.ipynb)
 - Regression Analysis (regression_analysis.ipynb)

To run through either Notebook, execute the one you are interested in and follow the analysis and conclusions for each.  These are not particularly mind-blowing in terms of visualisation but are a look into the start of Machine Learning in fairly simple terms.

The financial data used in this Project is exchange-rate pricing data for Canadian Dollar / Japanese Yen and found at `./Resources/cad_jpy.csv`.
